### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at [School of Computer Science](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/) and [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/), [Zhejiang University](http://zju.edu.cn/). My research lies at the intersection between Graphics, 3D Vision, and Machine Learning. I'm especially interested in *scene understanding through inverse graphics* and *digital human reconstruction*.

During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to work closely with [Prof. Xiaowei Zhou](http://xzhou.me/) on several research projects. In the past few months, I've spent a wonderful summer visiting [Stanford University](https://stanford.edu/), advised by [Prof. Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/).
