### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an incoming CS Ph.D. student at [Stanford](https://cs.stanford.edu). Currently, I'm a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at [School of Computer Science](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/) and [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/), [Zhejiang University](http://zju.edu.cn/).


My research lies at the intersection between Graphics, 3D Vision, and Machine Learning. Specifically, I'm interested in scene understanding through inverse graphics and digital human reconstruction. During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to work closely with [Prof. Xiaowei Zhou](http://xzhou.me/) and [Prof. Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/) on several research projects.


If you happen to find any shared research interests, don't hesitate to shoot me an email. I'm always up for potential collaborations.
