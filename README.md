### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an (incoming) CS Ph.D. student at Stanford, advised by Prof. Jiajun Wu. My research lies at the intersection between Graphics, 3D Vision, and Machine Learning. Specifically, I'm currently interested in physical scene understanding through inverse graphics.

Previously, I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at School of Computer Science and Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University. During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to work closely with Prof. Xiaowei Zhou and Prof. Jiajun Wu on several research projects.

If you happen to find any shared research interests, don't hesitate to shoot me an email. I'm always up for potential collaborations.
